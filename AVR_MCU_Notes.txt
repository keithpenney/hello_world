Atmel AtMega328P AVR Microcontroller Notes:


USART:
    The Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter can transmit/receive both synch and asynch serial data
    with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 data bits and 1 or 2 stop bits.
    Includes a high-resolution BAUD rate generator.
    The USART0 i/o pins are on PD1 (Tx) and PD0 (Rx)

    To enable to USART0, the Power Reduction Register (PRR) must have a 0 in the corresponding bit, PRR.PRUSART0

    Transmitter:
        Single write buffer.
        Serial shift register.
        Parity generator.
        Control logic.

    Receiver:
        Clock and data recovery units.
        Two-level receive buffer UDRn.
        Parity checker.
        Control logic.
        Shift register.
        Can detect frame error, data overrun, and parity errors.

    Pins:
        XCKn        External clock only used for synchronous transfer mode
