Eagle CAD Hacks

Editing:
    Rotate Item             Right mouse click
    Change layer            Center mouse click

Libraries:
    After creating a custom library, you need to enable it before using it.  This is done most simply by opening the
    Control Panel and finding the library in the "Libraries" tree.  If it has a grey dot next to its name, it is not
    enabled.  Click this dot to turn it green and enable the library.

    supply1.lbr             Supply symbols (GND, VCC, VDD, etc...)
    resistor.lbr            Resistors, capacitors of all different packages.
    semicon-smd-ipc.lbr     Nice generic symbols for diodes, transistors, etc.
    pinhead.lbr             Pin headers!
    smd-ipc.lbr             IPC standard SMD packages
    con-subd.lbr            D-Sub connectors

Eagle interprets certain characters in names as special syntax:
    >property               Declare a property called 'property'.  Used in labels e.g. ">name", ">value"
    name@X                  If we have multiple pins with the same function (but different numbers), we use this syntax
                            to distinguish the pins.  Eagle will ignore the '@X' part of the label in the schematic.
                            'name' is the pin function, 'X' is the pin number.
    !name                   If a name (e.g. a net name) is proceded by '!', it is interpreted as "active low" and
                            displayed with an overbar above the name.

Sheets:
    It's handy to break up a big schematic into sheets, each with some unifying function (e.g. voltage rails, cap bank)
    To move an item from one sheet to another, use GROUP MOVE (highlight a group then CTRL+Right Click to move)

Board Layout:
    SET PAD_NAMES OFF | ON; // Sets pad names off/on in board layout.

Copper Pours:
    Make a closed polygon on one of your copper layers.
    Use the "name" tool to change the net name to your intended net (usually power or gnd).
    View the polygon's properties to set the rules for isolation, orphans, etc.
    Select Tools->Ratsnest to fill.

Eagle User Language Script:
    Eagle has a built-in user language that looks a lot like C++ for scripting and automating jobs.
    See the help menu if you're curious.

Import Images:
    Images can be imported via ULP scripts.
    For fills, use "import-bmp.ulp"
    For line drawings, use "import-dxf.ulp"
    Regardless, scaling will likely be necessary.  Make sure to save before executing!
